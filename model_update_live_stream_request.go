	// Latency is the time from when the streamer transmits a frame of video to when you see it in the player. Set this as an alternative to setting low latency or reduced latency flags. The Low Latency value is a beta feature. Note: Reconnect windows are incompatible with Reduced Latency and Low Latency and will always be set to zero (0) seconds.
